# Unicorn Companies Project

A unicorn company is a private company with a valuation of at least $1 billion. Many current and recent unicorns are tech startups. These companies are often high-growth companies that have raised private funding aggressively and have differentiated business models in long-term growth markets. The aim of this project is explore and discover insights from a dataset of over 1,000 unicorn companies worldwide. Here I use PostgreSQL for Data Cleaning and Analysis.

## Objective

The chief goals in this project are to properly clean, prepare, and further analyze the data from different angles. Each phase will be concerned with distinct problems.

- In the Data Cleaning phase: handling NULLs, duplicates, unwanted characters, and typos.

- In the Data Preparation phase: creating and defining new columns, inserting values into them, and dealing with any abnormalities.

- In the Data Analysis phase: exploring the dataset, understanding the distribution of values through an Univariate Analysis, comparing multiple variables through a Multivariate Analysis, and extracting the key insights.

## Tools

The main tool used in this project is PostgreSQL. Some of the topics covered are:
- WHERE clause
- GROUP BY statement & aggregate functions
- COUNT / MIN / MAX / AVG functions
- UPDATE statement
- Data types overview
