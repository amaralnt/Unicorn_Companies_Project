# Unicorn Companies Project

A unicorn company is a private company with a valuation of at least $1 billion. Many current and recent unicorns are tech startups. These companies are often high-growth companies that have raised private funding aggressively and have differentiated business models in long-term growth markets. The aim of this project is explore and discover insights from a dataset of over 1,000 unicorn companies worldwide. Here I use PostgreSQL for Data Cleaning and Analysis.
